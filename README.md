# game-of-tones

A repository for development of interactive, web-hosted Game of Tones games for exploring the basic tonal systems of Oaxacan languages (Santiago Laxopa Zapotec, San Mart√≠n Peras Mixtec), as part of the outreach efforts of Nido de Lenguas at UC Santa Cruz.

Note (May 2021): Users outside UC Santa Cruz: Please note that work is currently in progress to develop documentation and tools for quick and easy implementation of this code for other languages. For now, please feel free to test it out, and let one of the contributors know if you have any questions.
